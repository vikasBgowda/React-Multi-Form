# React + Vite

![screenshot]

We have create and learned how to build multi-purpose form 
- if we can just change the requirements of the form we would be able to get the form inputs in-place without writing the input logic again for each compoents and differnet forms.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
